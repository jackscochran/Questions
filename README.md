# Question engine for txt files
This is a program that searches through a corpus of documents and returns the top FILE_MATCHES and SENTENCE_MATCHES that match the user's query. It does this by first tokenizing the documents, calculating the inverse document frequencies (IDFs) of the words in the corpus, and then ranking the files and sentences according to their term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores.

The main function prompts the user for a query and then calls the top_files and top_sentences functions to find the top matching files and sentences, respectively. The load_files function reads in all of the .txt files in the 'corpus' directory and stores their contents as strings in a dictionary. The tokenize function processes the documents by lowercasing all words, removing punctuation, and removing English stopwords. The compute_idfs function calculates the IDF values for the words in the corpus. The top_files function ranks the files according to their TF-IDF scores and returns the filenames of the top n matches. The top_sentences function extracts relevant sentences from the top matching files, calculates their TF-IDF scores, and returns the n top matches.
